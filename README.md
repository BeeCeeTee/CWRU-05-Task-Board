## I. Description
The purpose of this site is to create a task board which allows a user to add, categorize and delete projects based on their due dates. The user can drag a task from one column to another to change its status, and the task card will change color based upon the due date (future, past-due, nearing due). This data is stored locally and the cards persist upon reloading the browser.

## II. Usage

Click the "Add Task" button, fill out the fields, and click the "Add Task" button at the bottom of the dialog window. Then, simply drag the card into its appropriate status column. To delete a card, simply click the red "Delete" button on each card.
